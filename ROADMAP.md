# Roadmap

The canonical cross-repository implementation ledger is maintained in
`spice-agent/docs/implementation/README.md`. This repository does not maintain
a second phase numbering system.

The current contract is a complete OpenAI Responses implementation of
`model.Provider`: bounded request translation, streamed text, finalized tool
calls, usage, completion metadata, cancellation, typed redacted failures,
offline fake-HTTP coverage, and a completed opt-in live
Responses-compatible-provider acceptance.

The live acceptance is deliberately double-gated by a build tag and exact
environment opt-in. It requires an explicit endpoint and proves the real
bounded Responses streaming path, exact text, usage, and terminal completion
without adding network access to ordinary gates. The recorded OpenRouter proof
uses an exact zero-price `:free` route and does not claim first-party OpenAI
service behavior; an explicit first-party OpenAI mode remains optional.

Before a stable release, changes remain focused on compatibility evidence,
additional provider fixtures, and the signed architecture-proof distribution.
No milestone may add a parallel container, ambient discovery, raw content
telemetry, or retry after an observed stream.
