# Security policy

Report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub Security Advisories for this
repository. Do not include production credentials or sensitive response content
in an issue.

The provider never reads ambient OpenAI environment variables. Applications
must pass credentials through typed, secret-marked Spice configuration. Errors,
events, logs, manifests, generated files, and test fixtures must not contain API
keys, authorization headers, prompt bodies, or model output unless the owning
application explicitly chooses to retain content.

Only HTTPS API endpoints are accepted. Construction performs no network I/O.
Every request must use a caller-owned context and bounded timeout. Automatic
retry is limited to failures known to happen before streaming starts; an
ambiguous or partial stream is never replayed automatically.

Supported versions receive security fixes on the latest preview line until a
stable support policy is published.
